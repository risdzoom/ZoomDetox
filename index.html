<h2>Detox in your parent's basement</h2>
<p>COVID-19 has displaced many people, leaving them in embarrassing living situations. If you're wondering, yes we know. Don't worry, we won't tell anyone.
Zoom Detox doesn't discriminate, but rather open doors for self expression.</p>

<h2>Detox during work happy hour</h2>

<h2>Bring your pure bred to Zoom Detox</h2>
<p>We can't forget our furry friends that we purchased from a "family breeder." Now that you are locked inside with them, you can't hire a dog walker to take care of their real needs. Have them join Zoom Detox so they can distract you from the micro-management during your job.</p>

  sucessful your business is. We understand companies may be suffering from COVID-19 losses, so purchasing Zoom Detox is absolutely vital for
